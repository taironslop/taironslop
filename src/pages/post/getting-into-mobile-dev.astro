      <p>
        my journey into programming began in 2019 when i stumbled upon openai's hide and seek project. 
        the idea of ai agents learning to play hide and seek fascinated me and sparked my interest in artificial intelligence.
      </p>

      <p>
        back then, chatgpt didn't exist, and getting into ai meant doing basic machine learning stuff. 
        honestly, it was quite boring and made me lose interest pretty quickly.
      </p>

      <h2>the diffusion era</h2>
      <p>
        fast forward to the diffusion models era. i found a way to make money online 
        creating nsfw content with ai. it was incredible to actually make money through 
        the internet, but the work wasn't particularly fulfilling.
      </p>

      <h2>discovering new paths</h2>
      <p>
        while looking for alternative ways to make money online, i discovered the 
        indiehacker ecosystem. at the same time, i witnessed the birth of a new way 
        of development alongside llms, with tools like cursor.
      </p>

      <h2>mobile development</h2>
      <p>
        that's how my journey into mobile development began. i'm focusing on consumer 
        apps because that's what i find most exciting. the idea of creating something 
        that people can use in their daily lives is really appealing to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        i hope to find something truly fulfilling in this new path :)
